### Hi, I'm Claudio Gomes ðŸ¤˜

I'm a Brazilian developer and designer experienced in creating **web** and **mobile** experiences. 

There's always new tech out there and I love exploring them.

My hobby is helping small (mostly Open Source) projects, always looking to improve and adapt my skills and help others along the way.
